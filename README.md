# Angular MineSweeper using Angular 1.5 Components

This version of minesweeper is to show how to use angular to focus on the
presentation layer of your application and how to separate the business
logic out and use uni-directional flow for state changes.

Using this approach, makes it much easier to isolate problems and create
tests.  

This project is not a finished fully functioning version of minesweeper, it
is a functional demonstration on how you can separate concerns and
create very simple tests.

## Usage

```
cd tnw
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing

```
cd tnw
npm install
npm test
```

## Challenges

Finish testing the utils functions
Add more game logic to the minesweeper service
Implement a status Component
Make the grid dynamic
Keep score and persist scores

## Technologies

- ramdajs - a functional utility library that makes it very easy to isolate your logic
- hyperscript and hyperscript-helpers - my preference to writing html or html strings, some like it some don't it works great for me.

Every thing else should be vanilla angular js.
